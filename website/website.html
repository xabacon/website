            <p> startup motherfucker who doesnt have big knowledge in the programming world, and chose to try WebDev <br>
            other than that im pretty bored and spending my time trying to learn programming is better than spending it playing games<br>
            or anything of that sort. <br>
            So this  is practically a productive hobby :3</p>
